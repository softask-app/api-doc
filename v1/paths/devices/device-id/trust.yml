post:
  operationId: trustDevice
  summary: Trust A Device
  description: |
    Mark the device with the given `{device-id}` as "trusted".

    On success this endpoint will return, in it's response body, a 64 digit
    token that will be associated with the user and device hardware id.
    Future logins can utilize this token in combination with the user id
    and device hardware ID to auto-auth and create a session using the
    `/auth/auto` endpoint.  This allows devices to authenticate behind the
    scenes for a user without having to store the user's credentials.

    Once the token is issued, it cannot be retrieved or viewed via the API.
    A device that has made this call is expected to store that token locally
    for future use.

  summary: Untrust Device
  description: |
    Remove a device's trust token from the service.

    On success this endpoint will have removed any trust records for the
    device with the ID `{device-id}` for the current user.  A device is
    advised to remove it's own stored token after this action as it will
    no longer be valid in use with the `/auth/auto` endpoint.

    If the hardware id `{device-id}` is not known, is not attached to the
    logged in user, or is not trusted, this endpoint will return a 404.
