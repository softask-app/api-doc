  description: |
    Expires the user session.

    Clients should also discontinue use of the X-Api-Key header as the value
    is no longer valid.  Continued usage of an expired token will result in
    401s from any endpoint requiring a logged in user (the same behavior as
    if the X-Api-Key header was omitted).
